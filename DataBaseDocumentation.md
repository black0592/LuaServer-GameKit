Lua Database Documentation
==========================

Omg. Why.
Because Lua, that's why. No, it won't be the fastest. I don't know. Maybe this is just to prove what Lua is capable of.

It's like the story of the turtle and the bunny. The bunny is fast, but isn't smart - the turtle isn't fast, but is smart... (Interpret this your own way)

So what can we do?
==================

LDB manager has basically two services:
-> The server (You won't touch this a lot)
-> The client (Yeah you will touch this a lot)

The client can send requests to the LDB server. LDB is another process, so we can create secure environments for the database. We don't want it to get stolen, right? 
I will provide a plugin so queries can be sent while preprocessing HTML. 

Query Syntax
============

`use *dbname*`
