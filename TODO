To complete a game of Werewolves we need:

Backend:
-> Database management
--> This will run as local network server on the pc
--> You send commands over an interface to the db manager which will parse those
--> You always specify the database password.


Database:
-> Define databases
-> Define data types (equal, ineqaual)
-> Define primary keys for loops to other dbs
-> Define insertion functions
-> Define change functions

All tables should be able to be crawled via Lua tables
At the start of a server, a password for the database is asked. This will be used to login to the database.
